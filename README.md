# Practical data science for Multi-class Classification for Sentiment analysis of Product reviews:
- In this course, you will learn how to take your data science project from idea to production. You'll discover how to build, deploy, and scale data science projects, serving thousands of models to millions of end-users. You will learn to analyze and clean datasets, extract relevant features, train models, and construct automated pipelines to orchestrate and scale your data science projects. You will also learn to tackle complex data science challenges with sophisticated tools.
- One of the biggest benefits of running data science projects in the cloud is the agility and elasticity it offers, allowing you to scale and process virtually any amount of data.

__Course [1]:__
- In course1, you will learn how to ingest the data into a central repository and explore the data using various tools, explore and analyze the dataset using interactive queries and learn how to visualize the results.
- You will perform exploratory data analysis and detect statistical data biases.
- Next, you will learn to train machine learning models using automated machine learning techniques and build a multi-class text classification model using state-of-the-art algorithms.

__Course [2]:__
- In course2, you will dive deeper into building custom NLP models.
- You will construct a machine learning pipeline, perform feature engineering, and share your features with the organization using a scalable feature store.
- You will train, tune, and deploy your model, orchestrate the model workflow using ML pipelines and MLOps strategies.

__Course [3]:__
- In course3, you will optimize machine learning models and learn best practices for tuning hyperparameters and performing distributed model training.
- You will explore advanced model deployment and monitoring options.
- You will discover how to handle large-scale data labeling and build human-in-the-loop pipelines to enhance model accuracy and performance by combining machine intelligence with human intelligence.

__Prerequisites for this Specialization:__
- Proficiency in Python and SQL programming.
- Familiarity with building neural networks using deep learning Python frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Understanding the concept of building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.

__Benifits of performing data science on cloud:__
- By moving your data science projects into the Cloud, you are no longer bound by resource limitations, such as your laptop, CPU, or memory.
- You can run data analysis virtually on any size of data.
- You can slice your data and run data transformations in parallel.
- You can switch from CPU to GPU if you want to speed up your model training and you can do much of this in just a few clicks.

## Brief introduction:
- Artificial intelligence/AI, is generally described as a technique that lets machines mimic human behavior.
- Machine learning/ML, is a subset of AI, that uses statistical methods and algorithms that are able to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed.
- Deep learning is yet another subset of machine learning, that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data.
