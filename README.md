# Multi-class Classification for Sentiment analysis of Product reviews using Practical data science:
- In this course, you will learn how to take your data science project from idea to production. You'll discover how to build, deploy, and scale data science projects, serving thousands of models to millions of end-users. You will learn to analyze and clean datasets, extract relevant features, train models, and construct automated pipelines to orchestrate and scale your data science projects. You will also learn to tackle complex data science challenges with sophisticated tools.
- One of the biggest benefits of running data science projects in the cloud is the agility and elasticity it offers, allowing you to scale and process virtually any amount of data.

__Course [1]:__
- In course1, you will learn how to ingest the data into a central repository and explore the data using various tools, explore and analyze the dataset using interactive queries and learn how to visualize the results.
- You will perform exploratory data analysis and detect statistical data biases.
- Next, you will learn to train machine learning models using automated machine learning techniques and build a multi-class text classification model using state-of-the-art algorithms.

__Course [2]:__
- In course2, you will dive deeper into building custom NLP models.
- You will construct a machine learning pipeline, perform feature engineering, and share your features with the organization using a scalable feature store.
- You will train, tune, and deploy your model, orchestrate the model workflow using ML pipelines and MLOps strategies.

__Course [3]:__
- In course3, you will optimize machine learning models and learn best practices for tuning hyperparameters and performing distributed model training.
- You will explore advanced model deployment and monitoring options.
- You will discover how to handle large-scale data labeling and build human-in-the-loop pipelines to enhance model accuracy and performance by combining machine intelligence with human intelligence.

__Prerequisites for this Specialization:__
- Proficiency in Python and SQL programming.
- Familiarity with building neural networks using deep learning Python frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Understanding the concept of building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.

## Brief introduction:
- Artificial intelligence/AI, is generally described as a technique that lets machines mimic human behavior.
- Machine learning/ML, is a subset of AI, that uses statistical methods and algorithms that are able to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed.
- Deep learning is yet another subset of machine learning, that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data.
- Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines business and domain knowledge with mathematics, statistics, data visualization, and programming skills.
- Practical data science helps you to improve your data science and machine learning skills, work with almost any amount of data, and implement their use cases in the most efficient way.

__Benifits of performing data science on cloud:__
- Practical data science is geared towards handling massive datasets, that could originate from social media channels, mobile and web applications, public or company internal data sources, and much more, depending on the use case you're working on. This data is often messy, potentially error-ridden, or even poorly documented.
- Practical data science tackles these issues by providing tools to analyze and clean the data and to extract relevant features and leads to knowledge distillation and gaining insight from those large datasets.
- Developing and running data science projects in the Cloud is the agility and elasticity that the Cloud offers. If you develop data science projects in a local notebook or IDE environment, for example, hosted on your laptop or company-owned server pool, you are limited by the existing hardware resources. You have to carefully watch how much data you process, how much CPU processing power you have available to train and tune your model. And if you need more, you need to buy additional computer resources. This process doesn't allow you to move and develop quickly. Maybe your model training takes too long because it consumes all of the CPU resources of the compute instance you have chosen.
- Using practical data science, you can switch to using a compute instance that has more CPU resources, or even switch up to a GPU-based compute instance.
- Cloud allows training your model on single CPU instance __(scaling up)__, performing distributed model training in parallel across various compute instances __(scaling out)__.

- On cloud when the model training is completed, the instances are terminated as well. This means you only pay for what you actually use.
- CLoud allows you to store and process almost any amount of data.
- Cloud also comes with a large data science and machine learning toolbox you can choose from, to perform your tasks as fast and efficiently as possible.
